## Things

### One to One relationship
- A foreign key column is created in owner entity, in our example, Showtime owns ShowtimeSystem, so @JohnColumn will be used in Showtime entity.
- Foreign key column's name is the concatenation of the name of relationship in the owner side, _ , and then name of the primary key column(s) in the owned side.
- The owner is responsible for the association column(s) update, a side as not responsible for the relationship will use attribute mappedBy
- Besides that, we have other approaches for OneToOne at [here](https://howtodoinjava.com/hibernate/hibernate-one-to-one-mapping-using-annotations/)
